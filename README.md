## Problem 
Social issues are rising greatly after the COVID-19 pandemic period. Charities and NGOs are now struggling more than ever to fund their projects while the need for their work has increased multifolds. Solving the problem of donating to charities and matching what individuals currently have to organizations is a key point to consider in this day and age.
Charities face many problems some of which include increasing charity fraud, lack of trust and transparency, and lack of legitimacy of items. If it is easier for individuals to find them they can give the support to those who need it most faster. The judges should also care about this problem because it is something that affects everyone. Homelessness, food insecurity, lack of clothing, food hampers, and toy drives are all initiatives that charities have taken upon themselves to address and tackle. If we can make charities' lives easier by matching items to those who need them, we can help those who are most vulnerable.
